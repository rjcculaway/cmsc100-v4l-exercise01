		<h1> First Things First </h1> <!-- Name and Nickname -->
		<p>
			My birth certificate says that my name is <b>Rene Jotham C. Culaway</b>, but my friends call me <b>Jotham</b> for short. 
			When I want to trick people, though, I go by Rene. 
		</p>
		<h1> Second Things Second</h1> <!-- Favorite CMSC and GE subjects -->
		<p>
			So far, <b>my favorite computer science subject is CMSC 22</b>. It's the first time I have coded something so visual, after all. I get tired by command line interfaces. As for my GE subjects, I'd say that
			<b>Living Systems (SCI 11)</b> is my favorite thus far. I think that I have a lot of affinity with the biology subjects, if I do say so myself.
		<h1> On Programming Languages </h1> <!-- Favorite PL -->
		<p>
			<b>Python might probably be my first and last love</b>. It's quite easy to do most of the stuff I want to do in Python.
			C comes in second. Nothing can beat its simplicity.
		</p>
		<h1> Favorite Food </h1> <!-- Favorite Food -->
		<p>
			When it comes to healthy stuff, I <i>always</i> come back for more <b>nilaga</b>. It's got vegetables, meat, and quite a brothy, hearty soup that's not too rich.
			What else can you ask for?
